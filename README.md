This is the program I used to analyze data and generate figures for Helix stability of oligoglycine, oligoalanine, and oligo‐β‐alanine dodecamers reflected by hydrogen‐bond persistence (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.24665/full) and High-resolution crystal structures of protein helices reconciled with three-centered hydrogen bonds and multipole electrostatics (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123146)

You are welcome to contact chl556@ucsd.edu if you have any questions.
